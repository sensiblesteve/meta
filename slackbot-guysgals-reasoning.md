# Why the Auto Response?

Some words have multiple meanings and can be interpreted by members of the community as intentionally excluding them. In particular there was a point raised in #diversity about the word `guys` which can mean `males` or it can mean `people of any gender` depending on the context.

The only reason this bot exists is to make people think twice about what they are saying just in-case they are excluding members of the community. As long as you are respectful of all people irrespective of their class, race, gender, sex, disabilities, or any other attributes - everyone wins.

We want to be a loving and inclusive community, and we know that this community is made up of many individuals. Thus if the individuals are conscientious of how their words affect people, the community as a whole grows stronger.

# What we're not trying to do

The bot is not policing your language or stopping freedom of speech. You are welcome to say whatever you like whenever you like. You'll only get banned for misconduct. This bot is about getting people to be a little bit more aware of the language they use and how the thousands of different community members might interpret it.

# I don't agree with this, what now?

Unfortunately, the limitations of this bot only allow for copy changes at present. If you wish to you can code a better bot and hope that the admins will like it. Otherwise, just try to ignore it. It's REALLY not worth debating it.

Some relevant channels to look at include:
* `#meta-guys-response` - for talking about this specific slackbot.
* `#diversity` - Discussion of ways and means of ensuring that groups of people that are under-represented in tech do not feel excluded and are given equal opportunity to be a part of the community.
* `#others` - Stories, advice and sympathy on being an "other" in tech.
* `#codeofconduct` - Chatting about the ZATech [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/zatech/code-of-conduct).
* `#asktheadmins` - Want to ask the admins a question but not sure who they are or what's going on, this is the place.

# Some frequently asked questions 

* **Isn't `guys` gender neutral?** Yes, in some contexts, but not everyone agrees 100% of the time, [here's an unscientific survey](https://jvns.ca/blog/2013/12/27/guys-guys-guys/) that shows that there is some ambiguity in the interpretation of the word. If you find a better survey, please post it for discussion in the groups above. What is for sure is that some members of our community don't agree that `guys` can ever be used in a gender-neutral way. 
* **Why is the bot so bad? Why doesn't it DM the user, or x, or y?** The bot exists as it currently exists because it is what is possible with the automated responses. We know it sucks, but if you can code a better bot, please do. `#meta-guys-response` is a good place to propose a better solution.
